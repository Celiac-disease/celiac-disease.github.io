    <div class="main">
        <p>Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gliadin, a prolamin
        (gluten protein) found in wheat, and similar proteins found in the
        crops of the tribe Triticeae (which includes other common grains such
        as barley and rye).</p><b>Other grains</b>

        <p>Wheat subspecies and related species (such as barley, rye, triticale
        and Kamut) also induce symptoms of coeliac disease. A small minority of
        people with coeliac also react to oats. It is most probable that oats
        produce symptoms due to cross-contamination with other grains in the
        fields or in the distribution channels. Therefore, oats are generally
        <b>not</b> recommended. However, many companies assure the 'purity' of
        oats and are therefore still able to be consumed through these
        sources.</p>

        <p>Other cereals such as maize, millet, sorghum, teff, rice, and wild
        rice are safe for people with coeliac to consume, as well as noncereals
        such as amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat. Noncereal carbohydrate-rich
        foods such as potatoes and bananas do not contain gluten and do not
        trigger symptoms.</p><b>Risk modifiers</b>

        <p>There are various theories as to what determines whether a
        genetically susceptible individual will go on to develop coeliac
        disease. Major theories include infection by rotavirus or human
        intestinal adenovirus. Some research has suggested that smoking is
        protective against adult-onset coeliac disease.</p>

        <p>People exposed to wheat, barley, or rye before the gut barrier has
        fully developed (within the first three months after birth) had five
        times the risk of developing coeliac disease relative to those exposed
        four to six months after birth. Those exposed even later than six
        months after birth were found to have only a slightly increased risk
        relative to those exposed at four to six months after birth. Early
        introduction of grains is protective against grain allergies.
        Breastfeeding may also reduce risk with prolonging breastfeeding until
        the introduction of gluten-containing grains into the diet associated
        with a 50% reduced risk of developing coeliac disease in infancy;
        whether this persists into adulthood is not clear. Factors that can
        trigger symptoms include: surgery, pregnancy, infection and emotional
        stress.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Severe celiac disease leads to the characteristic symptoms of pale,
        loose and greasy stool (steatorrhoea) and weight loss or failure to
        gain weight (in young children). People with milder celiac disease may
        have symptoms that are much more subtle and occur in other organs than
        the bowel itself. It is also possible to have celiac disease without
        any symptoms whatsoever. Many adults with subtle disease only have
        fatigue or anaemia.</p><b>Gastrointestinal</b>

        <p>The diarrhoea that is characteristic of celiac disease is (chronic)
        pale, voluminous and abnormally malodorous. Abdominal pain and
        cramping, bloatedness with abdominal distension and mouth ulcers may be
        present. As the bowel becomes more damaged, a degree of lactose
        intolerance may develop. Frequently, the symptoms are ascribed to
        irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), only later to be recognised as celiac
        disease; a small proportion of people with symptoms of IBS have
        underlying celiac disease, and screening for celiac disease is
        recommended for those with IBS symptoms.</p>

        <p>Celiac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma
        (small intestine cancer) and lymphoma of the small bowel. This risk is
        also higher in first-degree relatives like siblings, parents and
        children, whether or not a gluten-free diet brings this risk back to
        baseline is not clear. Long-standing and untreated disease may lead to
        other complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis (ulcer formation of
        the small bowel) and stricturing (narrowing as a result of scarring
        with obstruction of the bowel).</p><b>Malabsorption-related</b>

        <p>The changes in the bowel make it less able to absorb nutrients,
        minerals and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.</p>

        <p>The inability to absorb carbohydrates and fats may cause weight loss
        (or failure to thrive/stunted growth in children) and fatigue or lack
        of energy. Anaemia may develop in several ways: iron malabsorption may
        cause iron deficiency anaemia, and folic acid and vitamin B12
        malabsorption may give rise to megaloblastic anaemia.</p>

        <p>Calcium and vitamin D malabsorption may cause decreased mineral
        content of the bone or bone weakening and risk of fragility fractures.
        A small proportion have abnormal coagulation due to vitamin K
        deficiency and are slightly at risk for abnormal bleeding.</p>

        <p>Celiac disease is also associated with bacterial overgrowth of the
        small intestine, which can worsen malabsorption or cause malabsorption
        despite adherence to treatment.</p><b>Miscellaneous</b>

        <p>Celiac disease has been linked with a number of conditions. In many
        cases, it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel disease is a
        causative factor or whether these conditions share a common
        predisposition.</p>

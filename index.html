        <h1>Celiac Disease</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that
        occurs in genetically predisposed people of all ages from middle
        infancy onward. Symptoms include pain and discomfort in the digestive
        tract, chronic constipation and diarrhea, failure to thrive, anaemia,
        stunting of growth (in children), and fatigue, but these may be absent,
        and symptoms in other organ systems have been described. Vitamin
        deficiencies are often noted in people with celiac disease owing to the
        reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients
        from food.</p>

        <p>Increasingly, diagnoses are being made in asymptomatic persons as a
        result of increased screening; the condition is thought to affect
        between <b>1 in 1,750 and 1 in 105 people in the United States, and 1
        in 100 in the UK</b>. Celiac disease is caused by a reaction to
        gliadin, a prolamin (gluten protein) found in wheat, and similar
        proteins found in the crops of the tribe Triticeae (which includes
        other common grains such as barley and rye).</p>

        <p>Upon exposure to gliadin, and specifically to three peptides found
        in prolamins, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase modifies the protein,
        and the immune system cross-reacts with the small-bowel tissue, causing
        an inflammatory reaction. That leads to a truncating of the villi
        lining the small intestine (called villous atrophy). This interferes
        with the absorption of nutrients because the intestinal villi are
        responsible for absorption. The only known effective treatment is a
        lifelong gluten-free diet. While the disease is caused by a reaction to
        wheat proteins, it is not the same as wheat allergy.</p>

        <p>This condition has several other names, including celiac sprue,
        nontropical sprue, endemic sprue, and gluten enteropathy.</p>

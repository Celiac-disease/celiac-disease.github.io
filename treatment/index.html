        diet</a>

        <p>At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free
        diet. No medication exists that will prevent damage or prevent the body
        from attacking the gut when gluten is present. Strict adherence to the
        diet allows the intestines to heal, leading to resolution of all
        symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun,
        can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal
        cancer and in some cases sterility. The diet can be cumbersome; failure
        to comply with the diet may cause relapse.</p>

        <p>Dietitian input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware
        which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a
        balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free
        products are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health
        insurance plans. Gluten-free products are usually more expensive and
        harder to find than common gluten-containing foods. Since ready-made
        products often contain traces of gluten, some coeliacs may find it
        necessary to cook from scratch.</p>

        <p>The term gluten-free is generally used to indicate a supposed
        harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact
        level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A
        recent systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less
        than 10 mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological
        abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been
        done. Regulation of the label gluten-free varies. In the European
        Union, the European Commission issued regulations in 2009 limiting the
        use of "gluten-free" labels for food products to those with less than
        20 mg/kg of gluten, and "very low gluten" labels for those with less
        than 100 mg/kg. In the United States, the FDA issued regulations in
        2013 limiting the use of "gluten-free" labels for food products to
        those with less than 20 ppm of gluten. The current international Codex
        Alimentarius standard allows for 20 ppm of gluten in so-called
        "gluten-free" foods. Several organisations, such as the Gluten-Free
        Certification Organization (GFCO), the Celiac Sprue Association (CSA),
        and the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (NFCA), also certify
        products and companies as gluten-free.</p>

        <p>Even while on a diet, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may be
        lower in people with coeliac disease. Studies in the United States have
        found that quality of life becomes comparable to the general population
        after staying on the diet, while studies in Europe have found that
        quality of life remains lower, although the surveys are not quite the
        same. Men tend to report more improvement than women. Some have
        persisting digestive symptoms or dermatitis herpetiformis, mouth
        ulcers, osteoporosis and resultant fractures. Symptoms suggestive of
        irritable bowel syndrome may be present, and there is an increased rate
        of anxiety, fatigue, dyspepsia and musculoskeletal
        pain.</p><b>Refractory disease</b>

        <p>A small minority of people suffer from refractory disease, which
        means they do not improve on a gluten-free diet. This may be because
        the disease has been present for so long that the intestines are no
        longer able to heal on diet alone, or because the person is not
        adhering to the diet, or because the person is consuming foods that are
        inadvertently contaminated with gluten. If alternative causes have been
        eliminated, steroids or immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine) may
        be considered in this scenario.</p>
